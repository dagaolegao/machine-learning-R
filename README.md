The model in this paper uses SVM to classify data processed by MACD which is an index used in stock pitch explained in next part. Then predict ups and downs given the test data to test the model’s validation. At last applying the prediction to transaction to calculate the cumulative return and maximum drawback ratio. Although the result is not satisfied especially considering the transaction cost. The cumulative return keeps going down. It is still a little step to quant. As my undergraduate major was finance. I’d love to apply the machine learning approaches for the Finance.
